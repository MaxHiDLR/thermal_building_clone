About
=====

The aim of oemof.thermal_building_model is to create easily
for 20 european countries a building model

can be optimized for a specific retrofit status, by using the
thermal inertia of the building and optimizing the internal air
temperature.

oemof.thermal_building_model is under active development.
Contributions are welcome.
